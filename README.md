## Hey there 👋

I'm [Abie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abie-luo-6b278932a/) (pronounced Ay-bee), a learning developer in ML/DL and aspiring software engineer.

You will usually find me working on ML projects, and if not, learning backend development in the meantime.

I use **PyTorch** and **Scikit-learn** to make my models.

I only have a few repositories, so feel free to look around! My favorite has to be the [spinning cube](https://github.com/cheeseybiscuits/cube), as I built on top of the concept by containerizing the code.
You can also look at my journey in learning ML/DL through my [journals](https://github.com/cheeseybiscuits/Google-Colab-ML-DL-PyTorch-Journal).

Fun Facts about me:
- I LOVE Minecraft. It's my favorite game of all time, and I have a gallery of all my projects in my build-gallery repository
- I have 2 cats
- I have many small hobbies:
  - Art
  - Music
  - Juggling
  - Reading
